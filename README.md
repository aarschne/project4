# Machine Learning Analysis of You Tube Metrics
The project is about predicting the views and revenue of you tube videos using Machine Learning models. The models used in the project are Deep Learning Regression, K-Means Clustering and Agglomerative Clustering.

# Description
To use unsupervised learning model “K-Means” to predict clusters of YouTube videos.
To use supervised learning model “Keras” to predict the revenue generated by YouTube videos.
To use supervised learning model “Keras” to predict the number of views of YouTube videos
To tune the supervised learning model to find the best hyperparameters.
