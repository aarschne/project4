# Machine Learning Analysis of You Tube Metrics
The project is about predicting the views and revenue of you tube videos using Machine Learning models. The models used in the project are Deep Learning Regression, K-Means Clustering and Agglomerative Clustering.

# Objectives
* To use unsupervised learning model “K-Means” to predict clusters of YouTube videos.
* To use supervised learning model “Keras” to predict the revenue generated by YouTube videos.
* To use supervised learning model “Keras” to predict the number of views of YouTube videos
* To tune the supervised learning model to find the best hyperparameters.

# Getting Started
1. ETL - First of all the data was extracted from Kaggle using this link  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/youtube-analytics-how-to-keep-your-viewers-engag. The data has 3 csv files and we decided to use two of them. The data was cleaned by dropping some columns and renaming the columns. The null values in the data were found and some rows were deleted.
2. Standard Scaler from scikit  is used to standardize the data and heat map is drawn using Seaborn to show the correaltion between the features.
3. Clustering is done using K- Means Clustering and Agglomerative Clustering.
4. In the next step, the Deep Learning Regression model is developed for the same data.
5. The cost per 1000 views column is multiplied by number of views and then divided by 1000.![image](https://github.com/aarschne/project4/assets/128007832/af375df8-56f6-4330-8540-39d76d73e0ef)
